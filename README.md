# Manage Contact width Firebase and React

## ðŸš€ About this proyect
I created this project to improve my Firebase, React and css skills. At the beginning of the project I started doing it with tailwind, but when I was advancing I decided to do everything with css, the truth is that it takes much more time, because having to define the className and pass to the css file and not being able to do it directly in the same component, made it take me longer to finish the project.

That's why you will see that this project needs tailwind because when removing the dependency it looked horrible, so I decided to leave it like that and will later remove the dependency.
